    <h1>Pork Chop with Mushrooms and Grape Tomatoes</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a fairly quick and absolutely delicious way to have very juicy, 
            so-tender-you-can-cut-them-with-a-fork pork chops. I use boneless chops 
            that are 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick for this and keep the other sides simple; 
            it's great with baby red potatoes or rice. I happened to have really great 
            chops, and some fabulous veggies on hand so I kept the seasoning simple. 
            I used a rather strong Viognier for the wine, but you could use any good white.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup white wine, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup oyster mushrooms, pulled apart but not chopped</li>
            <li>½ green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>½ small onion, minced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season pork chops with seasoned salt and lemon-pepper seasoning.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add seasoned pork chops; cook until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Pour 1/2 cup wine and water over the pork chops; bring to a simmer. Cook until chops are no longer pink in the center and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chops to serving plates.</li>
            <li>Stir oyster mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into the skillet. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until onion softens and all the liquid evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup wine, tomatoes, and butter. Cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve mushroom and tomato mixture over pork chops.</li>
        </ol>
